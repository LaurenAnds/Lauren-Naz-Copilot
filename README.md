# Lauren-Naz-Copilot
# we learned that copilot can quickly write a function in Python. We couldn't get the tests to run initially in the sum.py file and we asked Copilot why this was, and learned that this was due to the indentation - it was indented and therefore assumed this was part of the function.
# The experience was quick and the use of copilot made it easier to find a function that works. We don't know any Python which made it harder as we couldn't work through this ourselves to check if it was right/spot the issues and this made it harder to ask questions to Copilot, as we didn't know what we were looking for.

# second kata - we found that copilot writing the unit tests wasn't super accurate and it took a bit of effort to try and find the issues and get them fixed. However overall it was very quick rewriting the function in Python and getting most of the tests working.
